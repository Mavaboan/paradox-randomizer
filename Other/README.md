# paradox-randomizer

This program is designed as an external help for games made by paradox, a video game creator. Their games allow you to play as various different countries placed around the globe. As there are a lot of different nations to play in their games, it can be hard to choose. This program is supposed to make that process easiere, by allowing you to randlomly select a country with the click of a single button. 

As of right now, the program only works for the game "Hearts of Iron 4" (or HOI4), but we plan to add support for Europa Universalis 4 and Stellaris, two other games by paradox.
